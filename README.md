## From us to you, the NFT opportunists,
<p align="center">
  Ethblox is a social platform for users to share their NFTs, join communities, and make friends—with all posts and communication hosted on IPFS.
</p>

<p align="center">
  The goal of our project was to explore what's possible when integrating decentralization to the social media space. A very hot topic in the world right now is the centralization of tech giants that control users' data and censor what they choose—but web3 seeks to change this. 
</p>

<p align="center">
EthBlox gives users back the control over their digital identity by allowing them to communicate through their Ethereum address, making friends and joining NFT communities along the way. We aimed to focus on the social aspect of the dAPP as opposed to creating another marketplace like OpenSea in an experiment to see how IPFS and the blockchain can handle social media management.

And no, we are not a spin-off from Roblox, even though we sure as hell wish we were
